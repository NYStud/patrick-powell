# About Me

## College

I graduated from Missouri State University in December 2015 with a Finance degree and an Accounting Minor. While I was in school, I was a member of the Kappa Sigma Fraternity and held multiple positions with varying levels of importance.

These positions included:

| Position | Position |
|-----|-----|
| Marketing Chair |	Grand Scribe |
| Philanthropy Chair | Webmaster / Historian |
| Assistant Treasurer | Alumni Relations |

Throughout these various positions, I was responsible for managing a chapter with over 100 members, collaborating with members, alumni and other organizations on campus to raise money or awareness for various causes. Most notably, I planned two separate events that raised over $3,000 for the Wounded Warrior Project and $4,500 for the chapter.

# Professional Life
After graduation I knew I wanted to be closer to home, and decided to move to Kansas City. I spent the previous summer there for an internship and had friends and family trving there already, so the decision was easy.
